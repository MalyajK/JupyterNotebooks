# JupyterNotebooks
Popular Machine Learning algorithms applied on a variety of datasets

I will be updating this repository from time to time with implementations of machine learning algorithms and analytics reports.
I am just getting started so updates will be slow initially and I hope to pick up pace!
Mostly I will be using Jupyter Notebooks and occasionally R, to keep myself familiar with another alternative.
